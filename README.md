# Big Data Analytics Project

## Overview
This repository contains the deliverables and source files for the Big Data Analytics project, a culmination of various stages of analysis using big data techniques. 
The main focus of this project is to explore classification and machine learning methods to derive valuable insights from large datasets.

## Repository Structure
The repository is structured into multiple folders, each representing a different phase of the project. Below is a brief summary of the content and structure of the repository:

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
- **`data/`**: Contains raw data used in the analysis.

### 2. Data Cleaning
- **`data_cleaning/`**: Contains scripts used specifically for data cleaning, including handling missing values, outlier detection, and data normalization.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **`eda/`**:  Python scripts that explore the dataset to understand key features, patterns, and trends.
- **`eda_visualizations/`**: Generated plots and visualizations to support the EDA.

### 4. Classification
